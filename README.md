### Preparing for The Merge

Ethereum will deserve credit for completing a complicated move to PoS, but it is important to provide wider education around the specifics and ensure that Cardano does not lose ground unnecessarily.

The Merge selling points:
- "most secure blockchain" - Not your keys, not your crypto. Casper and slashing
- Possible increase in staking rewards from 4-5% to >8% (funded by gas fees?)
- Deflationary: centralised changes to monetary policy vs Bitcoin vs Cardano Voltaire
- 99% reduction in energy use vs Cardano always PoS and *verifiably carbon neutral*

CNC Vision
- All Cardano stake pools operating on 100% renewable energy
- CNC vs CNBG?
